🛍️ E-commerce Microservices Backend

This project is a scalable E-commerce Backend built with Golang (Go), designed using a Microservices Architecture to ensure modularity, performance, and scalability.

⚙️ Overview

The system consists of multiple independent services communicating efficiently via gRPC and unified under a GraphQL API Gateway, offering a seamless developer and client experience.

🧩 Services

👤 Account Service – Handles user authentication, registration, and profile management (PostgreSQL)

🛒 Catalog Service – Manages product listings and search functionality (Elasticsearch)

📦 Order Service – Processes orders, cart operations, and order history (PostgreSQL)

🧠 Architecture Highlights

🔗 gRPC for high-performance, type-safe inter-service communication

🌐 GraphQL API Gateway for flexible and unified data access

🗄️ PostgreSQL & Elasticsearch for reliable and optimized storage solutions

🧰 Modular, clean, and production-ready microservices design

🚀 Why This Project

Built to demonstrate how modern backend systems can leverage microservices, GraphQL, and gRPC to deliver scalable, maintainable, and efficient architectures for complex applications like e-commerce platforms.
